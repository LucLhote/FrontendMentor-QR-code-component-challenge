## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- ARIA roles

### What I learned

This challenge allowed me to work on a project with existing files and code. I'm the kind of person who likes to work from scratch, which is good and bad. This is my first challenge, and I hope to improve my way of working to be a better teammate in a professional project.

At the HTML/CSS level, I didn't encounter particular difficulties. What was good is that I practiced Flexbox with which I like to work. After submitting my work, I realized that I had accessibility issues. I discovered the ARIA roles that I did not know before.

This challenge also allowed me to discover more about GitHub and GitHub Pages. This is something very important to know when you are a developer. I'm glad I finally tackled this topic.

### Continued development

One of the things I'd like to do is switch between Flexbox and Grid. I don't use Grid often and it's a good project to practice it for a beginner.

### Useful resources

- [Doc GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart) - I followed the various links and understood better how to use GitHub. I also discovered GitHub CLI on MacBook.
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - It helped me create a live site for this challenge.
- [WAI-ARIA Roles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles) - This page explain about ARIA roles. I strongly recommend to take a look at it if you don't know about them.
