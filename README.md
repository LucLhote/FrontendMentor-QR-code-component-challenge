## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This challenge allowed me to work on a project with existing files and code. I'm the kind of person who likes to work from scratch, which is good and bad. This is my first challenge, and I hope to improve my way of working to be a better teammate in a professional project.

At the HTML/CSS level, I didn't encounter any difficulties and I didn't learn any new things. What was good is that I practiced Flexbox with which I like to work.

This challenge also allowed me to discover more about GitHub and the GitHub Pages. This is something very important to know when you are a developer. I'm glad I finally tackled this topic.

### Continued development

One of the things I'd like to do is switch between Flexbox and Grid. I don't use Grid often and it's a good project to practice it for a beginner.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1: Doc GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart) - I followed the various links and understood better how to use GitHub. I also discovered GitHub CLI on MacBook.
- [Resource 2: GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - It helped me create a live site for this challenge.
